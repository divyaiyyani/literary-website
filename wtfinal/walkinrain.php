 <h2>       WALK IN THE RAIN</h2><br>
 <p>  
As I stood on the threshold of college<br>
Watching the pouring rain<br>
My heart sank while thinking<br>
How will I get to the train?<br><br>

A voice called my name<br>
And I turned to see<br>
He held up an umbrella and asked<br>
Would you like to walk with me?<br><br>

I agreed readily<br>
As a blush crept up my cheeks<br>
We started down the long road<br>
Not knowing what to speak<br><br>

Words came on their own<br>
As slowly we started to talk<br>
I smiled and laughed freely<br>
During the long walk<br><br>

He handed me my bracelet<br>
That I thought I’d lost in the grass<br>
He said he wanted to give it earlier<br>
But never got a chance in class<br><br>

By now we’d reached the station<br>
He wistfully said goodbye<br>
I knew it was time now<br>
I knew I couldn’t lie<br><br>

My father had gotten a transfer<br>
I was shifting to Dehradun<br>
Today was my last day at college<br>
No chance to be back soon<br><br>

He gazed at me with sadness<br>
Clearly visible in his eyes<br>
I couldn’t look at his face for long<br>
And hastily said goodbye<br><br>

I looked at my alphabet bracelet<br>
It said,”LIFE IS A SURPRISE”<br>
As the world sped by outside the train window<br>
I thought,”Words can be so confusing at times”<br><br>
