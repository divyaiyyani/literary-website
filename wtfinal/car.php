 <h2>       THE CAR-PARK</h2><br>
 <p>                                              
The car-park remains unchanging<br>
As the surroundings evolve<br>
From the old tiny diner<br>
To the steel tower so tall<br><br>

The young trees around<br>
 Hear the ancient banyan talk<br>
Of lush green parks<br>
Where people used to walk<br><br>

The cars come here to socialize<br>
And hear the news wire<br>
To gossip like old ladies<br>
And rest their tired tyres<br><br>

The Lamborghini is shiny<br>
With her nose high in the air<br>
The rusty Toyota Corolla<br>
Looks at her with despair<br><br>

The Nano is bubbly and chirps<br>
Just like the sparrows around<br>
The Jaguar is sleek and silent<br>
And gets praises abound<br><br>

WagonR complains of her master<br>
Who never gives her a wash<br>
Her paint has faded under<br>
The mud that had sloshed<br><br>

The car-park remains unchanging<br>
As the surroundings evolve<br>
New cars and old cars will come and go<br>
But their memories won’t dissolve<br><br>
                                                                        -Divya Iyyani
